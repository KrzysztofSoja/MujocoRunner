    Critic network(s) for DDPG/SAC/TD3.
    It represents the action-state value function (Q-value function).
    Compared to A2C/PPO critics, this one represents the Q-value
    and takes the continuous action as input. It is concatenated with the state
    and then fed to the network which outputs a single value: Q(s, a).
    For more recent algorithms like SAC/TD3, multiple networks
    are created to give different estimates.

    By default, it creates two critic networks used to reduce overestimation
    thanks to clipped Q-learning (cf TD3 paper).
